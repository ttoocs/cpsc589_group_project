\subsection Cloud Modeling for computer graphics

This paper describes two ways to do cloud modeling, as well as two ways to do cloud rendering.
Both go about in a Physically-based, and a 'Ontogenetic' method, which is designed to visual replicate the physically based one.

For the rendering half, they're both based on ray-tracing over a depth map.

The paper also highlights that physically based ones seem to be _very_ computationally intensive, (however, this is in 1999 terms)

The paper also gives good references to other papers, and goes into sufficient detail to implement both Ontogenetic methods. (And possibly enough for the physically based methods, or at least enough to give a good guide about it, and references to help.)


-After reading, yeah, it seems fine to do a more advanced method, my comp is a supercomputer in 1999 standards.
